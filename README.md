# Reactions to LGBT/Feminist movies and Political tendency by state in US


- If peopleâ€™s opinion and interest towards LGBT/feminism movies are divided by state.
- If so, do their opinions/intersts towards movies correspond to the Party they vote for. 
    - I label states who vote for Republican party as conservative, and states vote for Democratic party as liberal based on  their general stance on gay rights and abortion.
    - Whether people from conservative states tend to give lower ratings on movies about LGBT and feminism. 
    - Whether people from conservative states are less interested in movies about LGBT and feminism.
